["The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE)

> Sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case. And that's good code.

> To me , the sign of good people I really want to work with  is that they have good taste.

> This is a small example , Good Taste is much bigger than this.

> Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns, and kind of instinctively and knowing what's the right way to do things.
