### [Space | Time Tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff#:~:text=A%20space%E2%80%93time%20Trade%20off,space%20usage%20with%20decreased%20time.)

A space–time Tradeoff or time–memory trade-off in computer science is a case where an algorithm or program trades increased space usage with decreased time.

Here, space refers to the data storage consumed in performing a given task (RAM, HDD, etc), and time refers to the time consumed in performing a given task (computation time or response time).

### Code Changeability/Simplicity | Code Readability Tradeoff

hint from "99-bottles-of-oop"

+ abstraction -> changeability(hard to understand)
+ concrete -> easy to read(hard to change)

### TODO
